# Japanese Class-Change Resource Analysis

The Japanese class-change screen uses a shared 15-slot global glyph list rather
than an FF-terminated byte string. The static resource and Fighter Elwin's
first candidate branch are now structurally and live verified.

## Confirmed Ownership

- Code `0x02BB60` loads 15 glyphs from `0x0A3C9C` into VRAM `0xD080`.
- Layout `0x0A3CBA` references slots 0..10 and displays
  `クラスチェンジできます`.
- Code `0x02BC0C` opens layout `0x0A3CDC`, which references slots 0..6 and
  displays the shorter title `クラスチェンジ`.
- Original slots 11..14 are `傭兵` and `魔法` and are shared by the detail UI.

## Korean Slot Plan

The builder preserves all 15 indexes:

```text
0..5   클래스체인지
6      space
7..8   가능
9..10  space
11..12 용병
13..14 마법
```

This makes the existing 0..10 layout read `클래스체인지 가능`, the 0..6
layout read `클래스체인지`, and preserves the two detail labels without
changing layout tokens or code. The original 15-word tuple is validated before
patching.

## Persistent And Runtime Progress

- The persistent player roster starts at work RAM `0xFFA4CC`. It contains ten
  records of `0x18` bytes. Within each record, class is `+0x00`, level is
  `+0x02`, and experience is `+0x03`.
- Manual save slot 1 starts at SRAM `0x194E`; the roster begins at slot offset
  `+0x30` and uses the same `0x18`-byte records.
- Runtime units start at `0xFF603C` and use `0x60`-byte records. Elwin's class
  is `0xFF603C`, level is `0xFF606A`, and experience is `0xFF606B`.
- Routine `0x011C78` copies runtime progress back to the persistent roster.
  Routine `0x0177D8` copies persistent progress into runtime units. Patching
  only the save-slot level/experience is therefore not stable across all
  preparation/deployment synchronization points.
- The level-up handler is `0x01480C`. Fighter class ID `0x01` needs 16 EXP at
  level 9 to reach the first class-change branch.

`tools/run_blastem_sequence.py` can patch a recovered manual slot with
`--manual-slot-commander-id`, `--manual-slot-level`,
`--manual-slot-experience`, and optional `--manual-slot-expected-class`. It
validates the slot marker, valid flag, scenario, checksum, and source class,
then updates the checksum. This is useful for structure experiments, but it
does not replace runtime synchronization verification.

## Fighter Elwin Candidate Proof

The original Fighter progression list at `0x082562` yields class IDs
`0x04`, `0x05`, and `0x0A`: `ロード`, `ナイト`, and `シャーマン`. The Korean
targets are `로드`, `나이트`, and `샤먼`.

`tools/build_class_change_probe_rom.py` builds an ignored diagnostic ROM. Its
Start-key wrapper constructs the same source-derived candidate array and jumps
to the stock UI at `0x02BB48`. A separate guarded end-turn wrapper gives only
Fighter Elwin the exact LV9/EXP16 trigger and then jumps to the stock level-up
handler. Neither wrapper is part of the production ROM.

BlastEm checksum `D1D7` verifies:

- long prompt `클래스체인지 가능`;
- short title `클래스체인지`;
- candidates `로드`, `나이트`, `샤먼` and their Korean `용병`/`마법` detail;
- Down navigation through all three rows and wrap from `샤먼` to `로드`;
- confirmation returns from the diagnostic UI to the map.

Accepted captures are
`captures/run/d1d7_class_change_start_trigger.png`,
`captures/run/d1d7_class_change_candidate1.png`,
`captures/run/d1d7_class_change_candidate2.png`,
`captures/run/d1d7_class_change_candidate3.png`,
`captures/run/d1d7_class_change_candidate_wrap.png`, and
`captures/run/d1d7_class_change_confirm.png`. Its retained state
`captures/analysis/d1d7_class_change_confirm.gst` is screen/navigation evidence,
not a controlled before/after application proof. The normal end-turn route is
retained in `captures/analysis/eb00_class_change_turn2.gst` and proves the
runtime change from class `0x01` to `0x04`, LV1, EXP0.

Candidate sets beyond Fighter Elwin's first branch and Hein's ten-branch chain
still require runtime coverage. Do not describe the entire class-change matrix
as complete until those commander and branch combinations have been sampled.

## Full Chain Inventory

`python3 tools/class_change_inventory.py` reads all ten source pointers at
`0x08253A` and generates `localization/class_change_chains.json` plus
`docs/class_change_chain_inventory.md`. The source contains 100 transitions
and 76 unique current/candidate combinations after duplicates are merged.
Each row keeps the original address, class IDs, Japanese name, Korean display
target, screen-verification state, and application-verification state.

The generalized probe also displayed Lester's source transition
`서펜나이트(0x10) -> 실버나이트(0x1D) / 서펜로드(0x1F) / 팔라딘(0x19)` on
checksum `D221`. All three rows and their `용병/마법` details are intact in
`captures/run/d221_c9_s10_candidate1.png` through `candidate3.png`.

That diagnostic used Elwin's active runtime record because Lester was not
present in Scenario 2. Its retained state did not establish a Lester
before/after transition. Treat `D221` as screen/navigation evidence only.

## Non-Elwin Runtime Application Proof

The probe now treats source-chain ownership and the active runtime record as
independent inputs. Runtime record index 1 starts at `0xFF609C`; this is Hein's
active record in the Scenario 1 test path. Two separate probes establish the
boundary between display and application:

- Start-display checksum `8EF4` uses commander ID 5, current class `0x03`, and
  candidates `0x0A/0x09/0x04` (`샤먼/소서러/로드`). All three rows and their
  `용병/마법` details are visible in
  `captures/run/8ef4_c5_s03_candidate1.png` through `candidate3.png`.
- GSTs `captures/analysis/8ef4_c5_s03_preconfirm.gst` and
  `8ef4_c5_s03_confirm.gst` have identical player runtime and persistent roster
  class fields. Direct Start confirmation therefore proves navigation only; it
  is not an application path.
- End-turn-only checksum `A8D7` preserves the normal Start menu. Selecting
  `턴 종료` enters the stock level-up handler and changes runtime record 1 from
  class `0x03` to `0x0A`, resetting level to 1. The result is retained in
  `captures/analysis/a8d7_c5_s03_after_turn.gst` and visibly rendered as
  `헤인 / 샤먼 / LV 1` in
  `captures/run/a8d7_c5_s03_hein_shaman_applied.png`.
- Start-display checksum `903C` covers Hein's next source transition,
  `샤먼(0x0A) -> 프리스트(0x11) / 비숍(0x12) / 메이지(0x13)`. Captures
  `captures/run/903c_c5_s0a_candidate1.png` through `candidate3.png` verify all
  three rows, class stats, mercenaries, and Korean magic lists without clipping
  or Japanese residue. This transition is screen-verified only; application
  remains pending.
- Start-display checksum `9037` verifies
  `소서러(0x09) -> 비숍(0x12) / 메이지(0x13) / 매직나이트(0x0D)`, and checksum
  `902B` verifies `로드(0x04) -> 메이지(0x13) / 매직나이트(0x0D) /
  하이로드(0x0B)`. Their `candidate1.png` through `candidate3.png` capture sets
  preserve all names, stats, mercenaries, and Korean magic lists. Both rows are
  screen-verified only.
- The automated capture tool then verifies Hein's remaining six rows:
  `프리스트(11)`, `비숍(12)`, `메이지(13)`, `매직나이트(0D)`,
  `하이로드(0B)`, and the terminal `위저드(15) -> 서머너(28)`. The accepted
  prefixes are `904f_c5_s11`, `904e_c5_s12`, `9050_c5_s13`,
  `904e_c5_s0d`, `9052_c5_s0b`, and `9037_c5_s15` under `captures/run`.
  Every candidate class, stat block, mercenary list, and Korean magic list is
  intact. All ten Hein source transitions are now screen-verified; only the
  initial `워록 -> 샤먼` transition is application-verified.

The commander-level batch runner next captured all ten Liana transitions. The
accepted prefixes are `8e91_c2_s02`, `8eb4_c2_s0a`, `8eb1_c2_s08`,
`8eab_c2_s04`, `8ed6_c2_s13`, `8ed2_c2_s0d`, `8ece_c2_s11`,
`8ece_c2_s12`, `8ec8_c2_s0b`, and `8eb8_c2_s19` under `captures/run`.
Visual review covers all 28 candidate frames and confirms the Korean classes,
stats, mercenaries, and magic lists without clipping, broken glyphs, or
Japanese residue. All ten Liana rows are screen-verified and remain pending for
application verification.

The next batch captured all ten Sherry transitions under prefixes
`8e90_c4_s01`, `8ea7_c4_s04`, `8eb0_c4_s06`, `8eb9_c4_s0a`,
`8ed7_c4_s0b`, `8ee1_c4_s0e`, `8ede_c4_s0f`, `8edd_c4_s12`,
`8ed4_c4_s13`, and `8ebd_c4_s21`. All 28 candidate frames were reviewed,
including the flying, unicorn, Ranger, Dragon Lord, and terminal High Master
branches. Korean class names, stats, mercenaries, and magic lists are intact;
Ranger's empty mercenary area is source data rather than rendering damage.
All ten Sherry rows are screen-verified and remain pending for application.

Commander 6 (Scott) then completed all ten source transitions under prefixes
`8e8d_c6_s01`, `8eab_c6_s06`, `8eac_c6_s05`, `8ea9_c6_s04`,
`8ee3_c6_s0f`, `8ede_c6_s0d`, `8ed9_c6_s0c`, `8eda_c6_s11`,
`8ed0_c6_s0b`, and `8ebf_c6_s1b`. Visual review covers all 28 candidate
frames, including the cavalry, flying, holy, and terminal Royal Knight
branches. Korean class names, stats, mercenaries, and magic lists render
without clipping, broken glyphs, or Japanese residue. These rows remain
screen-only evidence. The accepted evidence now covers 42 of 76 unique source
combinations; 34 remain. Shared transitions also complete Lana's chain without
a redundant emulator run, and Elwin's nine pending unique rows are the next
batch target.

Commander 1 (Elwin) next completed its nine previously uncovered transitions
under prefixes `8ea5_c1_s04`, `8ea1_c1_s05`, `8eae_c1_s0a`,
`8edb_c1_s12`, `8ed8_c1_s0b`, `8ed5_c1_s0c`, `8ed9_c1_s0d`,
`8ed8_c1_s13`, and `8eb2_c1_s1a`. All 25 candidate frames were reviewed from
the Japanese source chain through the terminal Hero branch. Korean classes,
stats, mercenaries, and magic lists are intact. The inventory now covers 51 of
76 unique combinations, with 25 remaining; these nine rows are screen-only
evidence.

Commander 9 (Lester) then completed nine uncovered transitions under prefixes
`8e97_c9_s01`, `8eae_c9_s05`, `8eb6_c9_s07`, `8ebf_c9_s0a`,
`8ee0_c9_s0c`, `8ee5_c9_s0d`, `8edf_c9_s12`, `8ed5_c9_s13`, and
`8ec7_c9_s1f`. All 25 candidate frames were reviewed, including the source MD
water chain through terminal Serpent Master. Korean classes, stats,
mercenaries, and magic lists are intact. Coverage is now 60 of 76 unique
combinations with 16 remaining; commander 7 (Keith) supplies the next eight
uncovered rows. These Lester rows are screen-only evidence.

Commander 7 (Keith) completed eight uncovered transitions under prefixes
`8e91_c7_s01`, `8ea9_c7_s04`, `8eb2_c7_s06`, `8eb8_c7_s08`,
`8ed3_c7_s0b`, `8edc_c7_s0d`, `8ed7_c7_s11`, and `8ebe_c7_s1e`.
All 22 candidate frames were reviewed, including `클레릭`, the flying chain,
and terminal High Master. Korean classes, stats, mercenaries, and magic lists
are intact. Coverage is now 68 of 76 unique combinations with eight remaining;
Aaron supplies five and Jessica the final three. These Keith rows are
screen-only evidence.

An in-battle `저장` confirmation in the isolated `A8D7` runtime did not set a
manual-slot valid flag or write a roster record to `save.sram`. It is not
accepted as persistent-save synchronization evidence. Runtime application is
proven; persistence across a normal scenario-clear save remains a separate
verification task.
